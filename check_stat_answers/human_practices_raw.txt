Dr. Julia Widom | 04/17/2024
Background
Dr. Julia Widom is an assistant professor of physical chemistry and molecular biology at the University of Oregon. Her research focuses on applying biophysical methods to analyze RNA-RNA and RNA-protein complex structures. As a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Oregon, she used spectroscopy to analyze nucleic acids. Dr. Widom used fluorescence techniques to analyze RNA folding as a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Michigan. Now, at the University of Oregon, she is a member of the Oregon Center for Optical, Molecular, and Quantum Science as well as an associate member of the Institute for Molecular Biology.
Goals
Our team sought Dr. Widom’s expertise on the analysis of RNA-RNA structures. Specifically, we hoped to discuss the potential of employing FRET, NMR, and/or SPR as analytical techniques to determine binding affinities of toehold–miRNA interactions. Additionally, we aimed to troubleshoot issues that arose during the synthesis of our toehold gBlocks.
Contributions
For the purposes of our project, Dr. Widom recommended FRET – opposed to NMR or SPR– as a more affordable and less expensive experimental method of determining binding affinity. We also discussed the intricacies of FRET, which would later be considered while planning binding affinity experiments. She explained that the protocol is akin to a titration, and recommended maintaining experiment affordability by truncating our toehold, thus excluding the RFP sequence. This operates under the notion that the binding affinity of the miRNA to the toehold is independent of the production of the reporter gene. Dr. Widom recommended that after obtaining FRET data, we use the Gibbs Free Energy from the miRNA unfolding and the toehold binding in order to calculate an equilibrium dissociation constant. 
Dr. Widom also suggested that we mimic the concentrations of salt naturally found in sample urine, as test kit concentrations are generally low. She explained that high concentrations of salts in the urine could impact the equilibrium dissociation constant; testing our toehold switches in urine-like salt concentrations would better reflect the performance of our devices in a true testing environment.
Implementation
From our conversation with Dr. Widom, we deduced that FRET would be the most cost-effective, efficient analysis method for our binding affinity experiments. Following Dr. Widom’s initial advice, we truncated our toehold switches to exclude the RFP reporter gene and only analyze the interactions between the hairpin structure and miRNA . Moreover, we modified our binding affinity experimental protocols to mimic the salt concentrations naturally found in patient urine to better model the test environment of the toeholds.

Dr. Jenna Mueller | 04/24/2024
Background
Dr. Mueller is an assistant professor of bioengineering at the University of Maryland and an associate of the Department of OB-GYN & Reproductive Science at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. She obtained her undergraduate degree in bioengineering and with a minor in Global Health Technologies from Rice University. From there, she obtained both an M.S. and Ph.D. from Duke University in bioengineering, where she designed optical systems to optimize accuracy during surgical excisions of cancer. Additionally, she completed a postdoctoral program at Duke University where she developed the Pocket Colposcope. Currently, her research at UMD emphasizes Human-Centered Design (HCD) and involves developing biomedical technologies that are affordable and accessible in LMICs.
Goals
We first met with Dr. Mueller to explore the foundations of designing a cervical precancer screening tool that can alleviate the disproportionate burden cervical cancer imposes on women in LMICs. During this meeting, we discussed how feasible our urine-based test concept was and how complex it would be to implement. This gave us valuable feedback on how our test could be marketed and deployed. We would eventually follow up with Dr. Mueller later in the competition cycle to receive feedback on our progress and further explore implementation considerations.
Our team was especially excited to meet with Dr. Mueller because of her work at Duke University developing the Pocket Colposcope. Now produced by Calla Health Technologies, the Pocket Colposcope provides a portable, cost-effective alternative to traditional colposcopy tools, which are routinely used in HICs for cervical precancer screening. Dr. Mueller has successfully translated this idea from her postdoctoral program to commercialization, and has tested its impact in over 1000 women across 8 countries. Dr. Mueller served as a role model for our team to employ Human Centered Design (HCD) practices while addressing health disparities from across the world.
Contributions
Meeting with Dr. Mueller greatly influenced how we frame CerviCare during scientific communication to best convey its clinical relevance. Moving forward, our team decided to focus on early stage (precancer) screening during biomarker selection to improve the efficacy of our device; early detection is known to improve patient outcomes as individuals are afforded more time for medical intervention. 
While meeting with Dr. Mueller, we also explored modeling our system using synthetic urine and initiated our research into the regulatory landscape associated with CerviCare. Dr. Mueller shed light on one the high costs of obtaining deployment approval from regulatory authorities; this was also confirmed by Dr. Dadone, and would catalyze subsequent conversations about different forms of clearance including FDA approval, the CE mark, and local health ministry approval. After learning from Dr. Mueller about equitable, human-centered design, we understood that our test could not rely on the cold chain. Robustness across temperatures and cost mitigation would be two imperative pieces to maintaining equitable access to CerviCare; this was a key piece of feedback during the early stages of our design that would be corroborated by future project advisors such as Dr. Ian White, Dr. Mary Dadone, and Dr. Samson Jarso. 
Implementation
The valuable lessons we learned about equitable access translated into the development of essentially every other aspect of CerviCare. Cold chain avoidance directed us towards lyophilizing plasmids containing our synthetic RNA devices onto a paper-based assay. This meeting shifted our frame of thinking to engineer with the user’s needs at the forefront of our minds, strive to test our constructs using synthetic urine, and begin to explore conversations with more experts – especially those with regulatory or on-the-ground capacity-building experience in LMICs.

Dr. Ian White | 04/30/2024
Background
Dr. Ian White is the Associate Chair and Director of Undergraduate Studies at the University of Maryland Department of Bioengineering. He is also a Professor of Bioengineering instructing courses on biomedical instrumentation and biosensing, a Fellow at the Robert E. Fischell Institute for Biomedical Devices, and the Principal Investigator of the Amplified Molecular Sensors lab. Dr. White received his PhD from Stanford University.
Goals
We met with Dr. White to gain valuable insight on a variety of topics. Our team aimed to learn more about improving the accessibility of our tool through Dr. White’s experience designing point-of-care devices. We also hoped to flesh out administrative aspects of our project such as laboratory space and recruitment.
Contributions
Dr. White immediately emphasized cold chain avoidance as a necessity for our device to be truly accessible in LMICs, and pointed to the lack of reliable electricity as a major reason for this. Moreover, we discussed further reducing costs as a means of improving accessibility to CerviCare. Dr. White noted that measuring fluorescence could be expensive due to the need for specific filters for RFP excitation and emission measurement; to combat this, he suggested that we investigate alternative (i.e. colorimetric) reporter genes that could be detected at a lower cost. Dr. White also generously offered instructional lab space (BSL2) to carry out our work and pointed us towards the Discovering Engineering educational program for high school students (see our Education page for more details).
Implementation
Dr. White’s suggestions were corroborated by several other stakeholders, and his insight served as a major inspiration for our team’s switch to NanoLuciferase as our reporter gene. Additionally, his generosity in lending us lab space allowed us to complete our work in a safe, well-equipped environment, significantly increasing what we were able to accomplish. He also inspired us to look for educational opportunities on campus like the Discovering Engineering program, which we detail on our Education page.
Dr. Megan McSweeney | 05/02/2024
Background
Dr. Megan McSweeney is a postdoctoral researcher in the Georgia Institute of Technology Styczynski Lab. She obtained a bachelor’s degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Rhode Island, and a PhD in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology. Dr. McSweeney has extensive experience creating and testing biosensors, and co-authored the 2023 paper “Short Activators and Repressors of RNA Toehold Switches”. This groundbreaking paper was the first to characterize toeholds targeting short (~20 nucleotide) RNA sequences, offering an updated design schema which influenced our toeholds.
Goals
When designing our first generation of toeholds, our literature review did not include papers about toehold switches targeting miRNAs or small noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs) – only papers pertaining to mRNAs. Because the fundamental purpose of our project was to detect miRNAs, this posed a serious problem. The discovery of Dr. McSweeney’s work with toehold switches that specifically target sncRNAs enabled the refinement of our toehold generation process. Upon analyzing her published paper, we encountered several toehold structure components that we were unable to connect to a certain function: mainly, the 5’ ends did not seem to carry a noticeable function and we were unsure as to why the sequences were included. We met with Dr. McSweeney to try to understand the functionality of the 5’ end sequences, and further improve our toehold design.
Contributions
Dr. McSweeney informed us that the 5’ end sequences were vestigial from a past project and were not included to add any functionality. She suggested that we not only experiment with the removal of the 5’ end vestigial sequences, but also to see the effects of sequestering the trigger sequence further into the stem loop.
Implementation
Our team’s second generation of toehold switches was designed using the structure of the toeholds developed by Dr. McSweeney as a model. Her work developing toehold switches targeting short RNA sequences directly contributed to the development of one of the main parts of our project, the toehold switches themselves. 
Ms. Heather Tyra | 05/06/2024
Background
Heather Tyra is a Synthetic Biology Product Support Specialist at Integrated DNA Technologies.

Goals
We met with Ms. Tyra to troubleshoot synthesis issues with our toehold switch gene fragments. Prior attempts to design gene fragments containing our toehold switches had resulted in failure on multiple occasions; our team hypothesized that the secondary structure of our switches may have impacted these issues. Ms. Tyra generously offered to look at our gBlocks and show us how to better design and analyze them.

Contributions
During our meeting, we shared our gene fragment designs with Ms. Tyra, along with the documentation IDT provided us when describing the failed syntheses. Ms. Tyra used analytical software to inspect their G-C percentage, repeats, and secondary structure. She specifically pointed out that the G-C percentage was low in the 30 base-pair regions of both the 5’ and 3’ ends of our fragments; additionally, there were repeats and long stem loops in one of our sequences. Ms. Tyra suggested that we redesign our gene fragments with a G-C percentage between 40% and 60%, avoid stem loops longer than 18 nucleotides, and keep repeats to a minimum.

Implementation
Our team applied Ms. Tyra’s feedback by instituting a rigorous, documented analytical process for gene fragment orders. Members began analyzing sequences for repeats, stem loop lengths, and secondary structure issues, and low G-C percentage at the 5’ and 3’ ends of our gene fragments before ordering. Additionally, we required all designs to achieve an IDT “Complexity Score” ≤ 7 (signifying low complexity) before ordering. Results were compiled in “Proposed gBlock” reports which were peer-reviewed and approved. After instituting these procedures, all future orders passed synthesis attempts with ease.
Ms. Anjali Verma (UMD Tiwary Lab PhD Student) | 05/21/2024
Background
Anjali Verma is a first-year PhD student in Biophysics at the University of Maryland who received her B.S in Applied Physics from Columbia University. She specializes in time-series prediction from representation learning and RNA binding proteins. Ms. Verma currently works in Dr. Pratyush Tiwary’s lab, where statistical mechanics, molecular simulations, and artificial intelligence are used to solve biological and chemical problems, including predicting protein and RNA flexibility.
Goals
We met with Ms. Verma to learn about modeling the interaction between our RNA devices and miRNA biomarkers using AlphaFold 3, an AI program that predicts protein and nucleic acid structure. We wanted guidance on how to use AlphaFold, how to interpret the results, and how to assess the accuracy of the results. In addition, we wanted to learn about other computational modeling programs we could use to model our toeholds. 
Contributions
Ms. Verma provided us with useful guidance on how to interpret our AlphaFold results. We were able to analyze AlphaFold structures of our toeholds on call with Ms. Verma. For example, we learned that, for any generated structure, the pLDDT score (a measure of the program’s confidence in the model on a 0 to 100 scale) should ideally be in the high 90s. She also suggested using other computational models as well, such as Vienna for secondary structure, pKiss for ribozymes, and Rosetta for tertiary structure. 
Implementation
The knowledge we acquired from Ms. Verma helped us to decide the most viable and stable structures to construct for our device based on computational evidence. After the meeting, we ran AlphaFold jobs on all of our toehold structures and were able to analyze these structures. With Ms. Verma’s guidance, we came to the conclusion that our pLDDT (a measurement of local structure confidence) scores were too low for us to confidently rely on our AlphaFold results. After determining a lack of need for the use of tertiary structure prediction for our project, our team chose to explore running pKiss and Rosetta on our toehold structures.
Dr. Bhudev Das | 06/04/2024
Background
Dr. Das is the director of the Amity University Institute of Molecular Medicine and Stem Cell Research in India. He earned his Masters of Science and Ph.D from Banaras Hindu University and has since published more than 200 research papers centered around molecular oncology. Currently, his research focuses on HPV epidemiology, miRNA regulation, and stem cell cancer biology and he aims to use his discoveries to improve access to quality treatment for HPV causing cancers such as cervical cancer. His pioneering work done with HPV has led him to establish the WHO Regional Referral Center for SouthEast Asia in his lab at the Institute of Cytology and Preventive Oncology. This work has also led him to earn several awards such as the J.C. Bose National Fellowship and ICMR’s B.R. Ambedkar Centenary Award for Excellence in Biomedical Research.
Goals
We sought to understand how Dr. Das’ team was able to determine the fold change across various miRNA biomarkers at different stages of cervical precancer. This information would help us to determine how to use our target miRNA biomarkers to differentiate between healthy, pre-cancerous, and cancerous states. 
Contributions
Dr. Das and his team explained that they used cDNA in order to get their fold change data (our team would soon learn that an established norm in the literature is to report in terms of fold change, not direct miRNA concentration values). From this data, they were able to develop a model to visualize significant levels of differentiation between discrete stages of cervical cancer. We became inspired to use a similar model with our own miRNA concentration data, with the intention of using this knowledge of stage differentiation to guide our device design with respect to its specificity. Additionally, Dr. Das explained the history of cervical precancer in India in order to provide context for the value of his research into cervical cancer. He greatly emphasized the importance and ongoing need for cervical precancer screening capabilities.
Implementation
From our conversation, we were able to further validate the potential impact our project could have on improving outcomes for cervical precancer patients. Additionally, we planned to use RT-PCR to quantify miRNA concentrations in our experimental samples.
Dr. Sydney Stern | 06/18/2024
Background
Dr. Stern is a pharmacokineticist and the director of Giant Cell Tumor Programs at TGCTSupport, an organization that aims to increase the quality of care for patients with Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumor. She has a Masters of Science in Clinical Research and a PhD in Pharmaceutical Sciences from the University of Maryland Baltimore. Her PhD focused on developing a drug-based treatment for breast cancer patients while improving patient responses to standard chemotherapy treatments.

Dr. Stern also currently works to educate both cancer patients and scientists about rare diseases through her pilot program From Cells to Communities. Through this work, she has collaborated with advisory boards such as the Sarcoma Patient Advocacy Global Network to create standardized guidelines for the treatment of rare diseases.
Goals
Our goals for this meeting were to discuss FDA regulatory processes and conduct an initial CerviCare impact assessment. When discussing our project’s goals and future directions, we highlighted two main components: feasibility of implementation in LMICs from the perspective of both inclusive design and regulatory considerations. 
Contributions
First we discussed current screening barriers in LMICs, a consideration which heavily informed the design of our device. She explained how LMICs typically have very limited lab spaces to train lab technicians and perform miRNA isolation from urine samples. She also described that there are often social and cultural barriers that prevent women from seeking the use of screening and diagnostic technology. For example, women in these countries often have to perform HIV and HPV screening tests discreetly due their stigmatization. In some cases, the potential of domestic violence is a threat that hinders screening. The combined impact of these barriers results in the need for an easy-to-use device that aims to uphold the user’s medical self-empowerment. After discussing our device’s design and intended usage protocols, we were provided with  suggestions to reduce the complexity of our device. In terms of test administration, this  consisted of using a shaking protocol to isolate our target miRNAs; this would address the concern of limited trained lab personnel. To adequately address social barriers after speaking with Dr. Stern, we were committed to making our device discreet and compact.
During this discussion, Dr. Stern described how luminescence-based detection using a luciferin substrate and luciferase tag would eliminate the need for lab-grade optical readers. She also stated that luminescence is a standard practice, and the enzymes necessary to implement it can be easily incorporated into a plasmid for use in our cell-free system. Due to these factors, she recommended that we explore luminescence as our detection method in lieu of fluorescence to improve deployability. 
When speaking with Dr. Stern, we obtained a new perspective on the domestic regulatory landscape. We gathered that if we pursue our project as a proof of concept in the U.S., we should strive to obtain clinical samples. Once our proof of concept is established, we will have to consider the classification of our device – this is something that we would later consult Dr. Mary Dadone about (see: 6/25/2024 meeting). In order to be an official screening device, CerviCare must attain at least 97% specificity, 93% sensitivity, and must significantly alter the course of treatment for patients. Dr. Stern explained that for our device, the numerical limits stem from historical conflation of screening and diagnosis in the scientific community; the effect of such a mishap can significantly alter the course of treatment that patients endure. If we do not meet these performance standards, she recommended that we pursue classification of our device as a companion device; these generally have more relaxed standards for approval since they act as pre-screening devices.
Implementation
Our discussion with Dr. Stern served as a turning point for our project’s development. First, we decided to further explore the option of deploying our device in a community setting. Although we decided against moving towards deployment in the U.S due to our commitment to helping women in LMICs, we looked into deploying our device in mobile health clinics in our target LMICs and sought out more stakeholders with experience deploying point of care devices in LMICs in order to further evaluate the feasibility of our device. Additionally, we sought out additional stakeholders specializing in FDA regulatory processes in order to fully understand the legal and regulatory landscape that we would need to navigate in order to deploy our device. Finally, we committed to undergoing a new DBTL cycle, shifting our detection method from fluorescence to luminescence. This led us to concurrently work with fluorescence while beginning to explore a NanoLuc-based luminescence system. 
Dr. Mary Dadone | 06/25/2024
Background
Dr. Mary Dadone is currently the Principal at Mary Dadone & Associates. She received her Ph.D. in Biological Sciences from the University of New Mexico, and has ample experience with regulatory strategization in the biotechnology industry. Dr. Dadone is a quality assurance professional with a specialty in medical devices. She has experience with GE Healthcare in regulatory filing for product development and enhancement for both Class II and Class III (intermediate-risk) medical devices.
Goals
We sought to meet with Dr. Dadone to discuss the regulatory processes that we should consider when attempting to deploy our device in LMICs. Additionally, we wanted to further explore several topics that arose from our previous meeting with Dr. Stern.
Contributions
Dr. Dadone described two different regulatory routes for deploying our device in LMICs: clearance versus approval. Clearance is generally less rigorous, less expensive, and quicker than obtaining approval; however, this approach is less flexible in terms of overseas deployment. 
We also wanted to learn about the basics of regulatory research to better understand our device from the perspective of a regulatory body. A common route of navigating the regulatory process is the use of a “predicate device” – one that has already been approved, and serves as a template for approval-grade functionality and foundational design.
In terms of the FDA, we were curious about whether the state approval process can affect subsequent federal approval. Dr. Dadone explained that generally this could only solidify the proof-of-concept for our device, not streamline the federal approval process. However, she advised that this route would give us experience with establishing a predicate device, implementing our device in a low-income area, and justifying the need for CerviCare. 
She also explained that although the FDA would need to approve of our device in order to be exported outside the U.S., obtaining approval in the U.S. does not necessarily mean that all countries will accept it. As such, we would need to go through some other countries’ approval process in order to implement our device there. We could obtain a CE marking to help with this, but she explained that this would be time consuming and expensive.


Due to the noninvasive nature of CerviCare, our design would likely result in a Class II FDA classification. As such, Dr. Dadone informed us that we would need to demonstrate device functionality within our target population. 
As we intend to make our device as cheap as possible, we inquired about the cost of the approval process. In our discussion, we learned that this is ultimately dependent on the country we are attempting to seek approval from and which path we decide to take (i.e. clearance or approval). 
Additionally, these costs vary by academic institution and tend to fluctuate depending on federal funding. She did mention that on average, the entire process costs around $9000 without including the testing that would be required to obtain clearance or approval. These tests must also be rigorous as we must prove that our device has a specificity of at least 97%, a sensitivity of at least 93%, has minimal Type I and Type II errors, and is exportable in our target LMICs. The combined impact of these factors mean that our device may exceed $60000 in terms of testing as it is de novo.
Finally, we wanted to discuss the factors that determine the feasibility of our device in our target LMICs. Aside from the cost of testing and manufacturing our device, we discussed the usability of our device as a key component of its design. From this conversation, we learned that providing clear, concise, and extensive documentation is essential for reasonably expecting users in our target regions to be able to use our device. We learned that developing clear instructions would be the most important step as we would very likely have to walk the user through the process of using our device. However, she warned that language localization and poor literacy rates will generally limit our instructions to be mostly or entirely visual in order to avoid those issues. She also warned us that we would need to obtain extensive documentation about the exportation process and materials needed for export in order to make sure that our target regions can receive a consistent supply of our device and so that our device can be kept safe during export.
	
Implementation
	From our meeting with Dr. Dadone, we decided to bolster our efforts to research the regulatory process more in depth so that we can modify our business plan accordingly. This included seeking out additional stakeholders to speak to, devoting more time into researching the FDA regulatory requirements and process relevant to our device, and seeking out guidance on how to design accessible instructions. Additionally, we searched through literature and the current landscape of point-of-care testing in order to find a predicate device.
Dr. David Boegner | 06/26/2024
Background
Dr. Boegner is a recent graduate of the University of Maryland, where he obtained a PhD in bioengineering. During his time there as an undergraduate, his bioengineering research explored sample-to-answer and paper-based diagnostics systems. Dr. Boegner also specializes in developing optical sensors for the recognition of medical biomarkers and developed his own camera-based sensor while developing his dissertation for his Ph.D.
Goals
We met with Dr. Boegner to get advice on fluorescence-based optical reader design. At this point in the cycle, we presented several device designs developed from our literature review that we sought feedback on.
Contributions
Dr. Boegner provided us with very useful feedback on our fluorescence reader designs. He emphasized the importance of designing a reader that is as intuitive to use as possible for individuals without experience. He advised us to consider how each component of the optical reader contributes to the overall complexity of the device. In addition, he suggested formulating a test that produces a binary output rather than a graded output. This is especially important in LMICs – in both private and community settings – to allow for volunteers and untrained personnel to operate the device.
We presented designs consisting of color- and geometric-based light filters. Dr. Boegner expressed that a combination of a 90o geometric conformation in the device and color filters would be sufficient for minimizing the background noise generated by the LED. He suggested that, rather than output to a microcontroller and computer, the binary output be directly included on the device itself due to heavily limited access to computers in LMICs.
Dr. Boegner also shared insights from his previous research on optical readers. He explained that cameras are very useful in the initial stages of prototyping and testing because they allow you to extract the most data from the device for troubleshooting, but are expensive for production. The goal for the device should be to use low-cost, easily available materials such as color sensors and resistors. In order to make changes more robust, he suggested we make the device modular – for example, allowing the color sensor to be switched for a camera with ease. 
Implementation
The meeting with Dr. Boegner greatly informed our device design. We since moved away from camera-based designs to simpler color and light sensors, since these are much less expensive and easier to manufacture with.  To maintain deployability in LMICs, we designed our optical reader to be modular, such that parts can be interchanged if necessary. More testing is needed to determine if the luminescence output from our device will be sufficiently stratified to allow for a simple binary output.

Dr. Ashok Palaniappan | 06/26/2024
Goals
Our primary goal in meeting with Dr. Palaniappan again was to discuss wet lab progress (specifically our toehold modification experiments), the machine learning model, and our software. In our previous meeting, Dr. Palaniappan suggested we build a machine-learning model to determine whether or not a patient has cervical precancer based on the concentrations of the three different miRNAs, the properties of the urine sample, and other potential confounding parameters. However, after our last meeting, we had a lot of trouble finding relevant data to use to train our model. We required miRNA data from the urine of patients who had varying stages of cervical cancer. We asked Dr. Palaniappan for further direction regarding data collection inaccessibility issues.
Contributions
In regards to finding data for our machine learning model, Dr. Palaniappan pointed us to The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). He specifically told us to look for CIN (cervical dysplasia) datasets. These databases provided a new route of exploration for our team. Dr. Palaniappan emphasized the importance of free energy in toehold design, which we directly applied to the redesign of our software. Dr. Palanaippan suggested building a feature to iteratively build, test, and improve the design of one’s toehold switch. To this end, we decided to include test results on the generator page so that users could easily go through multiple design iterations guided by immediate feedback. Dr. Palaniappan also said that we could extend our tool to building gene fragments containing toehold switches. Furthermore, Dr. Palaniappan suggested we look into base-pairing at the stem and the loop at the start codon when designing toehold modification experiments.
Implementation
We strove to incorporate many of Dr. Palaniappan’s suggestions – this started with coming through the TCGA and GEO data repositories, but were unable to find sufficient data to build a classification model. However, through the use of existing fold change data, our team established a threshold for our output. Through the advice of Dr. Palaniappan, we sought to measure a baseline miRNA concentration in order to use the fold change data in determining cutoffs. This meeting marked the start of our own DBTL cycle pertaining to our software tool. Our software has both the building and testing components which allows the users to make iterative changes and retest their design. Additionally, we designed experiments testing the base-pairing at the stem and the loop at the start codon as part of our toehold modification experiments. 
Dr. Samson Jarso | 07/08/2024 & 08/23/2024
Background
Dr. Jarso is an adjunct professor at Johns Hopkins university and the Founder and CEO of the Andromeda Innovation and Implementation Science. He obtained his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley where he worked within the biophysics department. After this, he pursued a postdoctoral fellowship in the FM Kirby Center at Johns Hopkins University. His current work focuses on strengthening healthcare in global settings and building stronger biomedical engineering capacities. He also established the Andromeda Institute for Implementation Science with the assistance of the business office at Johns Hopkins University, the Department of Radiology, and the Center for Bioengineering Innovation and Design where he works on improving access of biomedical devices to low-income settings. He aims to implement his work in Uganda, where he currently lives, to strengthen their healthcare system through medical capacity building.
Goals
We sought to meet with Dr. Jarso in order to discuss the specific attributes that make a point-of-care device accessible in LMICs. Additionally, we wanted to maximize the accessibility of to discuss how to design our device to accommodate these factors to maximize its accessibility.
Contributions
	We used Dr. Jarso’s experiences with designing and implementing point-of-care devices in Ghana and other LMICs to guide our conversation about our device’s accessibility. First however, we wanted to learn about problems that paper-based tests typically encounter in their design and implementation. He explained that previous attempts to develop these assays have a large capacity for user error, are prone to false negatives, are overengineered which increases complexity, and fail to recognize the different deployment options available, are cell phone-based, private and public, which can lead to inefficiency and increased costs. However, he mentioned that our device is designed in a way that is new to him which could mean that it already bypasses some of these limitations. Regardless, we should work to avoid these shortcomings and do extra research to ensure that we avoid these common pitfalls.
	When designing devices, he explained some common issues that arise once the device is deployed. The main problem he described is the misuse of the device by healthcare providers and the user. By incorrectly using the device, he warned that users will obtain illegitimate results or misinterpret the results which would reduce the device’s ability to be accurate. In order to combat this, he suggested performing a pilot participatory design study with a non-working prototype in order to assess how people are able to comprehend the instructions for our device. Alternatively, we suggested performing a study by giving patients a few different prototype designs to assess which one is most user-friendly to mitigate misuse.
	One method he proposed to confirm the accessibility of our device was to develop a medical access model. He explained that these models are computational simulations, typically performed in MATLAB, that takes a sequence of variables and outputs the likely increase in accessibility to cervical precancer screening compared to the test’s accuracy. The variables involved are flexible, but they typically include a country’s annual GDP, population density, proportion of the population living in urban areas, and the accuracy of the device.
Implementation
After our meeting, we decided to formally pursue the creation of a medical access model that wouldin order to assist us in evaluatingthe evaluation of the feasibility of our device. To accomplish this, we devised a task team to research and attempt to develop a computational model that considers a wide range of variables most directly relevant to the feasibility of our device. Additionally, we scheduledestablished recurring meetings with Dr. Jarso in order to advancediscuss the progress of this model and receive guidance in its development.

Goals
We continued our correspondence with Dr. Jarso in order to receive support in the conceptualization of all aspects of our medical access model.
Contributions
In our discussion of our medical access model, we aimed to discuss the computational modeling, business planning, and healthcare knowledge needed for developing it. We received examples of the output of a medical access model he developed. From this, we gained ideas on how to output our own data such as by displaying a density map or a planar distribution detailing areas that must be targeted. Additionally, we learned that the model must also include important business factors that impact our device such as shipping costs, inflation, and fluctuations in market prices. Finally, we discussed a model that one of his students uses that details the elements of a successful healthcare reform plan.
Implementation
After our meeting, we re-evaluated our current stage of development with our medical access model. From this, we decided to integrate our business plan into the development of the model in order to more accurately reflect the economics that impact our device’s accessibility.

Dr. Patricia Bates is a technical service scientist at Promega Corporation. She received her PhD in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, and performed research on negative strand RNA viruses prior to her work at Promega Corporation. She also served as an adjunct instructor for classes on anatomy, chemistry and biochemistry at Ursuline College for several years. 
Goals
After winning the Promega iGEM sponsorship, we were awarded $2,500 of Promega products. We had previously met with stakeholders to discuss the use of luminescence as a reporter for our cell-free screening test, but had yet to order the necessary materials. Our literature review had revealed NanoLuciferase as an efficient luciferase reporter gene, but we had yet to decide on which luciferin substrates to use for our experiments. We met with Dr. Bates to discuss which luciferase protein and luciferin substrate would work best for our cell-free expression test.
Contributions
We discussed the typical setup of a test using a luciferase and luciferin, and how to apply it to our specific situation. We discussed the modularity of the reporter gene and the ability to easily replace the RFP sequence with the luciferase sequence. Dr. Bates confirmed that NanoLuciferase, an engineered Promega Corporation protein, would function as the best luciferase available to us. She explained that the protein was small, efficient, and gave incredibly high luminescence output upon catalyzing the luciferin substrate. This meant that our screening test would have a clear visual output, without a need to worry if the signal is strong enough to be measured. Dr. Bates explained to us the differences in functionality between the different luciferins that Promega sells, and we discussed furimazine in depth. She explained that furimazine would be an optimal substrate for our test. Furimazine is a novel analog of coelenterazine, the luciferin utilized by deep sea shrimp. Promega studies have shown that the NanoLuc-furimazine combination produces a luminescence over thirty-fold greater than that of the NanoLuc-coelenterazine combination, meaning that our test would deliver a clear, strong output in the presence of the biomarker.
Implementation
Taking into consideration the insight that Dr. Bates provided, our team designed a gBlock containing the NanoLuc protein sequence, with the proper restriction sites and overhangs to facilitate insertion through Gibson Assembly into the plasmid that the toehold switches were inserted to. The RFP sequence was removed through restriction enzyme digest and functionally replaced with the NanoLuc sequence. Generation 2 RFP toehold switches were modified so that the RFP linker sequence of the gBlock was replaced with a NanoLuc linker sequence. Furimazine was ordered from Promega using our $2,500 credit, and although the toehold switches were never tested, work was done when developing optical reader to make the design luminescence-compatible.
Dr. Sharon Aviran | 07/18/2024
Background
Dr. Aviran is an Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering at the University of California, Davis where she focuses on applying biocomputational methods to medical challenges. Her previous work consists of using chemical methods to probe the structure of RNAs in biological contexts. In recent years, she has adopted computational biology as her main focus of study. Currently, she studies RNA folding by developing software to predict and model these folding mechanics in cells. Her current projects consist of analyzing biological throughput data to analyze the thermodynamics of RNA folding, develop algorithms to analyze predictive structure models, and generate data for use in applications.
Goals
Our primary goal in meeting with Dr. Aviran was to discuss the computational modeling of the secondary structure of our toehold switches through software tools such as RNAstructure. WFrom this, we aimed to receive guidance in determining which gain a better understanding which software tools would be the most appropriatewe should explore in order forto accurately and efficiently modeling our toehold switches’ structure. 
Contributions
We discussed her opinions on the design of our toehold switches and our project more broadly. From this, we learned that we should re-evaluate our current computational structure models to include the reporter sequence and the folding of the entire plasmid in our in vitro system. This is because both of these elements are essential parts of our system and will interact with the miRNA before and after our toehold switches are expressed. Additionally, we learned that calculating the least free energy conformation of our toehold switch is not the only metric we should consider when modeling their structure. Instead, we should also consider the viable free energy range these constructs should exist in as well as consider entropy as most models determine a local conformation structure and then assign free energy values. 
After receiving feedback on our project, we discussed ViennaRNA as an effective tool for our purpose of modeling the secondary structure of our toehold switch-miRNA complexes. We had previously not explored ViennaRNA software as well as RNAStructure and NUPACK. Dr. Aviran recommended we also use Vienna as it enables us to visualize and export the probabilities of our toehold switches binding to their miRNA at specific nucleotides. Additionally, it provides entropy predictions which is crucial in determining the relative stability of our toehold-miRNA complex. 
Implementation
We are working on developing another scoring metric within our software tool through a feature that gives a numerical score to toeholds based on the probability of each nucleotide being correctly paired with the desired nucleotide. Additionally, we used ViennaRNA for secondary structure and free energy predictions while designing our second generation toeholds.

Dr. Dean is the the Ron and Jane Lindsay Family Innovation Professor of Bioengineering at Clemson University where she is also the principal investigator of the Multiscale Bioelectromechanics Lab. She obtained her Ph.D from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2005 where she studied electrical engineering and computer science. She began her work at Clemson in 2007 where she focuses on characterizing biological tissues on a nano- to micro-scale level by evaluating several experimental techniques. Dr. Dean also spearheaded Clemson’s implementation of mobile COVID-19 testing centers using her experience with designing accessible devices and implementing them in low-resource areas
Goals
Our primary goal in meeting with Dr. Dean was to evaluate the design of our device in terms of its accessibility and its ability to address the barriers that women commonly face when attempting to access reproductive care in LMICs.
Contributions
We explained our project to provide context for our meeting and future discussions. From this, we were able to receive direct feedback on our project’s design. Mainly, we discussed our choice of optical sensing and logistical roadblocks that we could potentially face when deploying our product. In our discussion, we prefaced that we were in the process of switching our reporter gene from red fluorescent protein to NanoLuc as after speaking with other experts in her field, we determined that a luminescence-based device could be more accessible than a fluorescence-based device as it boasts more global ubiquity. We learned from her that this dilemma is more complicated as although luminescence detectors may be more ubiquitous, fluorescence technology can be cheaper and less complex if only one excitation wavelength is used. As our device would only have one excitation source per well and only one excitation wavelength, she explained that fluorescence could still be feasible if the optical reader was simple enough. On the contrary, she also noted that if our NanoLuc toehold switches produced enough output, then we could use the color of the urine as a basis for measuring relative miRNA concentration which would drastically reduce our device’s complexity. For both models, she explained that we would need to establish a lower limit of detection in order to set a baseline for comparing normal miRNA concentrations with clinically significant concentrations. Although we were aware of this, she pointed out that if our lower limit of detection was zero or close to zero,  we would have a lower clearance bar as we would not have to prove that our lower limit is a nonzero number. From this, our test’s complexity could also be reduced as our device could report whether or not any miRNA was detected.
She also presented us with some logistical concerns that we would likely face when attempting to implement our device. These limitations consisted of distribution concerns such as finding distribution sites willing to sell or donate our device as well as usability concerns as for example, sometimes a water based assay may be more appropriate as a clinician can mix the urine and the necessary reagents which could be easier than a patient attempting to use a paper-based assay themselves. 
We were also interested in her opinions on the accessibility of our device and the screening barriers that we should consider when implementing our device. First, we wanted to understand if our device would be more well-suited for at-home use or in a community setting such as a mobile health clinic. She explained that as, per U.S. standards, our device would be considered to be moderately complex, it may be more appropriate to deploy it in a community setting. This is because people may struggle to read and interpret the results of our test as even though each well has a binary output, literacy in many LMICs is limited which inhibit’s patient’s ability to accurately read the test’s instructions. Additionally, there is no guarantee that patient’s will pursue follow-up care after using the device. She explained that this is a part of a larger trend in LMICs where education about healthcare is very limited which not only inhibits a patient’s ability to understand at-home testing, but also introduces a significant level of misinformation in some cultures which discourage women from seeking treatment for reproductive cancers. If we were to pursue deploying our device in a community setting, she recommended that we accomplish it through non profit organizations, especially ones who already deploy mobile health clinics, or the WHO as they frequently deploy screening devices in LMICs as a part of their efforts.

Implementation
We decided to giveperform further deliberationanalysis toon our decision to switch to a luminescence-based system from a fluorescence-based system sinceas, given her feedback, we realized that fluorescence may still be reasonable to pursue. From this realizationanalysis, we determined that luminescence wouldill still be the better option for us as the optical sensing equipment necessary wouldill be cheaper and the NanoLuc reporter gene produces enough output to reduce the necessary concentration of toehold switches needed to reach our lower limit of detection.

Background
Dr. Balsam is a scientific and regulatory reviewer for the FDA’s branch of Devices and Radiological Health. He earned his Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from the University of Maryland where he optimized methods of optical sensing for in vitro diagnostics. He then moved his work to the FDA where he focused on evaluating and testing flow cytometry as a method for detection in point of care diagnostics. He currently works in Devices and Radiological Health leading the device approval process branch.
Goals
Our primary goal when planning this meeting was to gain insight into the regulatory process surrounding the development and implementation of predicate devices, specifically in the realm of optical detection techniques.
Contributions
Dr. Balsam gave us valuable insight into the work that goes into developing a test that uses optical detection; we were curious about hearing his experiences using fluorescence and luminescence for biomarker detection and point-of-care testing. We learned that luminescence generally does tend to be a cheaper option than fluorescence, as it does not require an excitation source or optical filters. This is regarded to come at the cost of functionality, since fluorescence systems are modular – a key component of fluorescence which enables multiplexing. However, he explained that since our device will produce the same output in each toehold switch, the inability to perform multiplexing would not hinder our device in a luminescence assay. We then spoke about the use of cheaper color sensors in optical devices, where we determined that even though they have a lower efficiency, our NanoLuc reporter should produce enough of a high quality signal to offset this. 
Implementation
This meeting further cemented our rationale for further testing our toehold switches with both NanoLuc and RFP, and gave us valuable insight into the optical detection process we intend to employ. Methods of lowering test cost, like those discussed in this meeting, were critical to the development of our project.
Dr. Dhanu Thiyag | 08/08/2024
Background
Dr. Dhanu Thiyag is a clinical instructor of biomedical engineering and a Global Women’s Health Fellow at the University of Michigan’s Center for Global Health Equity. Dr. Thiyag obtained her MD from Temple University from which she proceeded to an OB/GYN residency with UI Health in Chicago. Recently, she obtained a Masters in Public Health in Health Behavior and Health Equity from the University of Michigan. Her current work focuses on utilizing her biomedical engineering and medical OB/GYN backgrounds to advance women’s reproductive and sexual health. She develops devices, models, and programs to improve health outcomes for women in LMICs, including her resident country of Ghana. Her specific research and projects focus on pertinent topics in women’s health including sexual health, reproductive health, gender equity in the healthcare system, maternal and infant mortality, and healthcare quality.
Goals
Our primary goal in meeting with Dr. Thiyag was to discuss the accessibility of our device in Ghana, an LMIC, and current barriers that women face in Ghana when attempting to access cervical cancer screening.
Contributions
After explaining our project and requesting feedback on the design of our device, we learned that since our project is outside the standard of care for cervical cancer, that being cytology and HPV screening, we needed to have a very sound basis for the science behind our device’s functionality. Dr. Thiyag explained that our device must be at least comparable to the standard of care screening procedures, and that we should be able to demonstrate sufficient functionalityshow that it works. When we discussed the impact our device could have for women seeking cervical cancer screening in Ghana, she explained under the assumption that our device worksthat, assuming our device works, that it has the potential to help women avoid common barriers that prevent them from seeking cervical cancer screening:; high costs of healthcare, poor access to treatment centers, and social stigma surrounding women obtaining treatment to list a few being several. Dr. Thiyag cautioned us that in order to reach this stage, we would have to perform extensive testing to prove that our device meets the minimum specificity and sensitivity standards in addition toas well as setting guidelines for our device. This is because our method uses novel detection technologies, so there are limited standards of how to use our device. She described several methods of achieving this, which includes writing instructions, making graphics for the use of the device, setting guidelines for the frequency in which to use our device, and follow-up care instructions. She also explained that we would need to perform multiple tests and experiments in order to determine the recommended frequency of use for our device. This would include a pilot experiment to determine the sensitivity and specificity of our device, a large sample trial to isolate the clinical biomarkers, and finally a large-scale, clinical longitudinal study to determine the optimal time to use the device.
Implementation
From this feedback, we delved deeper into the impact that our device could have and what we would need to do to ensure that our device produces our desired outcome. This critical thinking is important for any project, but specifically becomes necessary with a project developing a screening test. Given the limited time scope of the iGEM cycle, an important part of the process is developing a long-term plan for your project: this is important not only to show the breadth of development of your project, but to build a framework for other teams or invested individuals to build upon. Dr. Thiyag’s extensive advice was critical for the development of that plan, and her insight into the steps that would need to be taken was invaluable for all the work our team performed related to the deployment of CerviCare.

Dr. Bruce Shapiro | 08/13/2024
Background
Dr. Shapiro is currently an NCI Scientist Emeritus, having retired from the NIH National Cancer Institute in 2021. He obtained his Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Maryland in 1978 after completing his undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Physics. During his time at NIH, he used his computer science background to develop models, algorithms, and software to probe many aspects of RNA biology. This included probing the structure of RNA, mapping the structure of RNA to its function, and RNA nanobiology among other topics. While employed as the principal investigator of the RNA Biology and Design Tools lab, he published multiple softwares including KNetFold, NanoFolder, and RNA Junction Database.
Goals
Our primary goal in meeting with Dr. Shapiro was to discuss his expertise in computationally modeling the secondary and tertiary structure of RNA so that we could gain a better understanding of how to model our toehold switch constructs. As he specializes in developing software for his computational models, we sought out information about his models and their use cases. Namely, we were interested in his SHAPE and KNetFold softwares as we identified that they would be the softwares that would suit our needs
Contributions
From our discussion, we learned that he used ViennaRNA, RNAStructure, and phylogenetic analyses to develop these softwares. This piqued our interest sinceas, after speaking with other computational biologists, we identified and researched ViennaRNA and RNAStructure for our own purposes. From this, we gathered that we could use a similar approach to develop our own modeling software in the future. We were also interested in how he interprets the results from his softwares as this would be essential for using and deploying our own softwares. He explained that our method of interpretation largely depends on the use-case we are looking for and the software itself. For example, he described that by calculating distances between target regions, we can visualize potential interference patterns that may arise in the 3D structure of our toehold switch. Additionally, we delved into molecular dynamics as another method of modeling our system. We were interested in this approach as we suspected that it would give our team a better understanding of how our toehold switches will behave in a urine sample and its binding mechanics when the appropriate miRNA is present. We learned that although it could be a useful simulation, molecular dynamics tends to require a hefty amount of parameter data that we have not determined experimentally yet which limits its use for us. He recommended that we instead use more high level models that incorporate molecular dynamics such as RNAnanobase, Hydrogen Affinity Testing, and SHAPE until we can experimentally confirm the necessary variables for molecular dynamics.
Implementation
From our meeting, we plan on evaluating SHAPE as a method of evaluating our toehold switches and incorporating these results into our toehold generation software.
Dr. Julia Kramer | 08/14/2024
Background
Dr. Kramer is an Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Michigan where she combines her engineering and public health experience to promote more accessible designs for medical devices. She obtained her bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Michigan before moving on to obtain two masters degrees in mechanical engineering and public health at the University of California, Berkeley. Using her previous training, she completed her Ph.D. at the University of California, Berkeley where she performed multiple case studies analyzing the effectiveness of multiple organizations in their attempts to increase access to cervical cancer screening in India and Nicaragua. Currently, she is the principal investigator at the University of Michigan’s Engineering, Design, and Global Equity Lab where she incorporates human-centered design into her medical devices in order to promote health equity and improve access to medical technology in LMICs.
Goals
Our primary goal in meeting with Dr. Kramer was to discuss the most common barriers that women face when attempting to access cervical cancer screening. We also aimed to discuss her dissertation which was a case study analyzing the effectiveness of several organizations attempting to increase access to cervical cancer screening.
Contributions
First, we wanted to discuss her dissertation work in order to establish context for her expertise. We were interested in her case studies regarding the effectiveness of several organizations in Nicaragua and India in promoting cervical cancer screening and helping women access these screening measures. After discussing her work, we learned that the most successful organizations focused first on raising awareness about the importance of screening. She explained that this was due to a lack of awareness about the importance of screening to facilitate early detection of cervical cancer which leads women to not seek treatment until symptoms start, by which it is already too late. Additionally, she noted the importance of addressing HPV infections in our device’s design and marketing. This is because HPV is inextricably linked to cervical cancer incidences and the prevalence of misinformation regarding the use of contraceptives, in regards to how women view its potential effects on their health, prevent them from using them. Additionally, this link means that it may be of use to us to deploy our device in partnership with common contraceptive brands and HPV tests to destigmatize the use of contraceptives and incentivize patients to use our device in conjunction with contraceptives. When deploying our device, she cautioned that we must consider the level of education that patients have regarding literacy and device usage as most patients in low and middle income countries have limited experience with at-home testing. As such, she recommended that we attempt to focus our efforts on deploying our device in countries where urine-based testing infrastructure is already present so that we can implement our device as a complement to pre-existing standards.
Implementation
From our meeting, we plan on modifying our business plan to better reflect how contraceptive use and HPV screening complements our device. Additionally, we will develop instructions for our device that includes educational information about the importance of screening in order to dispel myths about screening and concurrent contraceptive use.
