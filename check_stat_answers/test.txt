Background
Dr. Palaniappan is an associate professor of bioinformatics at SASTRA University and was the advisor of the 2019 SASTRA iGEM team. He obtained his Ph.D in bioinformatics in 2005 at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign’s Center for Biophysics and Quantitative Biology, and taught at medical schools and other universities before coming to SASTRA University. His research interests include applications of computational methods to biological problems, modeling biophysical systems and networks in medical and synthetic contexts, and applying machine learning to assist these goals. Additionally, he was the advisor of the SASTRA University iGEM team during their 2019 “House of Toeholds” project – an early source of inspiration for CerviCare.
Goals
Our team was inspired to meet with Dr. Palaniappan after reading one of his papers in literature review for our first generation of toehold switches. The paper focused on a computational approach to identifying miRNA biomarkers of cervical precancer, as well as his work with the SASTRA iGEM team. Based on this work, we aimed to discuss the design of our Generation 1 toehold switches with Dr. Palaniappan and obtain feedback on our planned validation experiments.
Contributions
During our meeting, we discussed different approaches to identifying early stage cervical cancer biomarkers. Through our initial literature review, we came across several computational-based biomarker validation methods; we brought questions concerning each of these to Dr. Palaniappan. The main method we discussed was using pre-existing datasets to model the validity of biomarkers in our cell-free system. We also discussed the potential advantages and disadvantages of incorporating machine learning into our design approach. Quickly, we learned that a persistent lack of urine-based miRNA concentration data in existing literature would hinder this endeavor. However, Dr. Palaniappan suggested that in the future, if enough concentration data emerges, it would be useful to test a machine learning model to determine the accuracy of this approach. Dr. Palaniappan’s input ultimately guided us towards validating our toehold switch efficacies through RNA computer modeling and simulated trials using synthetic miRNA.
Implementation
Per Dr. Palaniappan's suggestion, we sought to develop and train our own machine learning model. However, upon conducting an updated search for miRNA expression profiles, our team was unable to find sufficient data in existing literature to pursue this project avenue. Alternatively, we began to develop a toehold generation and validation software with two goals in mind: to create an improved iteration of toehold switches and facilitate ease-of-design to the broader synthetic biology community. Our Generation 1 toehold switches were developed using guidelines from Green et al., 2014 – a paper which laid an impactful rational design groundwork for these synthetic RNA devices. To fulfill our first goal, our software would include guidelines from McSweeney et al. 2023. This course of action resulted in a later meeting with Dr. Megan McSweeney herself (see: 5/2/2024 meeting), and ties into our second software goal: provide a platform for other iGEMers to test their designs against guidelines from current literature. More details pertaining to the toehold switch generator/validator tool can be found on our Software and Contributions pages. Finally, we scheduled a follow up meeting with Dr. Palaniappan to discuss results from our machine learning research  and troubleshoot any issues we encountered (see: 6/26/2024 meeting).
